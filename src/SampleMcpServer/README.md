# MCP Server

This README was created using the C# MCP server project template.
It demonstrates how you can easily create an MCP server using C# and publish it as a NuGet package.

The MCP server is built as a self-contained application and does not require the .NET runtime to be installed on the target machine.
However, since it is self-contained, it must be built for each target platform separately.
By default, the template is configured to build for:
* `win-x64`
* `win-arm64`
* `osx-arm64`
* `linux-x64`
* `linux-arm64`
* `linux-musl-x64`

If your users require more platforms to be supported, update the list of runtime identifiers in the project's `<RuntimeIdentifiers />` element.

See [aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide](https://aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide) for the full guide.

Please note that this template is currently in an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please take a [brief survey](http://aka.ms/dotnet-mcp-template-survey).

## Checklist before publishing to NuGet.org

- Test the MCP server locally using the steps below.
- Update the package metadata in the .csproj file, in particular the `<PackageId>`.
- Update `.mcp/server.json` to declare your MCP server's inputs.
  - See [configuring inputs](https://aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide/configuring-inputs) for more details.
- Pack the project using `dotnet pack`.

The `bin/Release` directory will contain the package file (.nupkg), which can be [published to NuGet.org](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package).

## Developing locally

To test this MCP server from source code (locally) without using a built MCP server package, you can configure your IDE to run the project directly using `dotnet run`.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "SampleMcpServer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "<PATH TO PROJECT DIRECTORY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the MCP Server

Once configured, you can test the MCP server with various commands:

### Random Number Tools
- Ask Copilot Chat for random numbers: `Give me 3 random numbers`
- It should use the `get_random_number` tool and show you the results.

### Pomodoro Timer Tools
The server includes several Pomodoro Timer tools:

1. **Console Pomodoro Session**: `Start a 25-minute work session with 5-minute breaks`
2. **Graphical Pomodoro Session**: `Launch a Pomodoro timer with graphical interface` 
3. **Get Pomodoro Status**: `What's the status of my Pomodoro session?`
4. **Stop Pomodoro Session**: `Stop my current Pomodoro session`
5. **Available Languages**: `What languages are available for the Pomodoro timer?`

#### Available Pomodoro Commands:
- `start_pomodoro_console` - Starts a console-based Pomodoro session
- `start_pomodoro_graphical` - 🆕 Launches the Pomodoro Timer with graphical interface
- `stop_pomodoro_session` - Stops the current session
- `get_pomodoro_status` - Gets session status
- `get_available_languages` - Shows supported languages (en, fr, es, ja, ru, zh)

#### Example Usage:
- "Start a 30-minute work session with graphical interface"
- "Launch a Pomodoro timer in French with 25 minutes work and 10 minutes break"
- "Stop my current timer session"

## Publishing to NuGet.org

1. Run `dotnet pack -c Release` to create the NuGet package
2. Publish to NuGet.org with `dotnet nuget push bin/Release/*.nupkg --api-key <your-api-key> --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`

## Using the MCP Server from NuGet.org

Once the MCP server package is published to NuGet.org, you can configure it in your preferred IDE. Both VS Code and Visual Studio use the `dnx` command to download and install the MCP server package from NuGet.org.

- **VS Code**: Create a `<WORKSPACE DIRECTORY>/.vscode/mcp.json` file
- **Visual Studio**: Create a `<SOLUTION DIRECTORY>\.mcp.json` file

For both VS Code and Visual Studio, the configuration file uses the following server definition:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "SampleMcpServer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": [
        "<your package ID here>",
        "--version",
        "<your package version here>",
        "--yes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
